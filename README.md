### ✨ High-Level Squizzy Concept 

The **Squizzy** application is designed as a standard user-friendly **quiz game** with the following flow and components:

---

## 🚀 User Flow

1.  **Selection**: The user first chooses a **Theme** for the quiz.
2.  **Difficulty**: The user then selects a **Difficulty** level (e.g., Easy, Normal, Difficult), which determines the number of questions, the point value of each correct answer, and the time limit for the quiz.
3.  **Game**: The user answers the questions one by one within the time limit.
4.  **Results**: After completing the quiz, the user receives a detailed **Score** report.

---

## 📊 Results and Evaluation

The final results page provides a comprehensive breakdown of the player's performance:

* **Final Score**
* **Success Rate** (Percentage of correct answers)
* Breakdown of questions answered correctly based on their **Difficulty**.
* A descriptive **Evaluation** (e.g., "Excellent," "Average") based on the final score.

Would you like me to elaborate on the **data structures** or the **page transitions** in this conceptual flow?
